# Touhou-4-Lotus-Land-Story-NES-Demake
An NES-style adaptation of the PC-98 game.

**NOTE:** If you want to download and play the demake, please click [here](https://drillimation.itch.io/touhou-4-lotus-land-story) to access its itch.io page.

***Touhou 4: Lotus Land Story*** was originally released for the PC-98 by Team Shanghai Alice in 1998. Drillimation Systems, the developer best known for the *Chuhou Joutai* series, ported the game to PC in the style of an NES game using the GameMaker engine in 2022. It is the fourth game in the highly popular Touhou Project series.

Reimu Hakurei and Marisa Kirisame return as playable characters. The plot is pretty much the same as the second game with the Hakurei Shrine being overrun by youkai again. This time, the adventure takes a turn and leads to Mugenkan, where the playable characters will either fulfill their best dream or see their worst nightmare. *Lotus Land Story* also marked the debut of Yuuka Kazami, who would later return as a playable character in *Touhou 9: The Phantasmagoria of Flower View*.

*Lotus Land Story* may have been famous for the song *Bad Apple!!*, but the game wasn't known to many players until the NES demake port released. Before that, *Touhou 6: The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil* is the game that formally introduced most players to the *Touhou Project* franchise. As a result of the demake, the game is now playable on modern machines without the need to configure an emulator.

## About this repository
In 2023, Drillimation released the source code for the game. This repository is intended for GameMaker users wanting to develop their own retro style *Touhou Project* fangame or danmaku shooter, or to improve upon its flaws.

This source code is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial license (CC-BY-NC). Because the game itself is based on the second actual *Touhou Project* game, we have chosen to release it under that license.
